# Averages

    Mean = sum of all element / no of element
    Median = when number is sorted in ascending order then middle number is median. incase even number 2 middle number sum/2
    Mode = Frequently occur element in series.


    variance = how far data is deviate from mean
             =  (xi - M)2/n   = (sum of data-mean)2/no of element


    standard deviation = square root of variance

    ex.
        3 4 5 6 7
        (mu) Mean = 5

        (sigma)2 variance = 3-5=-2, -1, 0, 1,2
                4+1+0+1+4/5 = 2

        (sigma) standard deviation  = square root of 2 = 1.41



    Alternate Formula:

    vairance (sigma) =  sum of element square/n -  (sum of element)2/n2



    effect on mean and standard deviation of adding fix price or adding 20%

    adding fixed 1000
    new Mu = 1.Mu + 1000
    new sigma = 1. sigma+0

    adding 20%

    new mu = 1.2.Mu+0
    new sigma = 1.2.sigma+0



    Standard Score

    standard Score of given data in series

    zee = x-mu/sigma


# outliers

    data point which is drastically differ from other data point that is removed from stastics.
    for this we use interqurtile range


    interquartile range = upper quartile Q3 - lower quartile Q1


    1) for even data set
        1, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 11

        q1 = 3+4/2
        q3 = 6+7/2

    2) for odd data set:
        1 ,2 ,3, 4, 5,6, 7

        q1 = 2
        q3 = 6
