# 100DaysOfMLCode


# Day 1 (High School Math):

    I have Done with Scatterplots. creating scatterplots and estimatiing lines. it helps to understand relation between data.
    and find pattern and we can make prediction using this pattern


# Day2 (High School Math):
    Done With plotting distribution, historgram and reading it. studied mean, median, mode. finding missing data point if mean is given. studied
    range, variance, standard deviation, interquratile range, creating box plot for iqr

# Day3 (High School Math):
    Done With Data Distributions comparing, reading two way frequency table, creating two-way frequency table, reading two-way relative frequency table, and creating two-way relative frequency table, intepreting two-way frequency table.

# Day4 (High School Math):
    Done with two-way frequency table whose show relationship between cateogrical variables. its unit test.

# Day4 (High School Math):
    Done With Sample and Survey. I have learned about types of collecting sample random, systematic, stratified, cluster, recognising valid claimes based on given sample.
    making inferences from random samples.
