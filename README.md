# High School Math From Khan Academy
# Day 1 (High School Math: Plots):

    I have Done with Scatterplots. creating scatterplots and estimatiing lines. it helps to understand relation between data.
    and find pattern and we can make prediction using this pattern


# Day2 (High School Math: Mean, Median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation etc):
    Done With plotting distribution, historgram and reading it. studied mean, median, mode.
    finding missing data point if mean is given.studied range, variance, standard deviation,
    interquratile range, creating box plot for iqr

# Day3 (High School Math: frequency table, two-way frequency table):
    Done With Data Distributions comparing, reading two way frequency table, creating two-way frequency table,
    reading two-way relative frequency table, and creating two-way relative frequency table,
    intepreting two-way frequency table.

# Day4 (High School Math: two-way frequency table):
    Done with two-way frequency table whose show relationship between cateogrical variables. its unit test.

# Day5 (High School Math: sample, survey, claims etc):
    Done with Sample and Survey. I have learned about types of collecting sample random, systematic, stratified,
    cluster, recognising valid claimes based on given sample.making inferences from random samples.

# Day6 (High School Math: statistical study etc):
    Done with Different type of statistical studies and experiments. Learned how to identify appropriate
    statistical study sample,observational or experiment for given problem. learned cause and effect and correlations

# Day7 (High School Math: probability etc):
    Done with Probability. I have learned about simple probability, experimental probability,
    making prediction with probability, comparing probabilties, probability model, counting principal, permutations and combinations.

# Day7 (High School Math: probability, permutation, combination etc):
    I have completed probability with counting, permutation and combination and done its practice.

# Day8 (High School Math: independant probability, dependant probability etc):
    I have completed compound probability of independent events,
    free throw probability, identifying independent and dependent probability.
    multiplicayion rules for dependent probability. done its practice

# Day8 (High School Math: Adding probabilities and venn diagram etc):
    I have completed adding probabilites using venn diagram and two way tables.
    also quiz for independent and dependant probability, adding probabilities.

# Day9 (High School Math: Probability Test, Polynomial Distribution, Normal Distribution(Empirical rule) etc):
    I completed probabiltiy Test, Polynomial Distrbution, Normal Distribution (empirical rule).

# Day 10 (Statistics:Udacity):
    Complete first five units of statistics from udacity.
    gone through scatterplot, barchart, histogram, piechart, admissions case study, looking at data

# Day 11 (Statistics:Udacity):
    gone through probability and conditional probability of statistics udacity
